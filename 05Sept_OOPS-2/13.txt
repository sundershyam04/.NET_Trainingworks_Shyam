13) NO, We can't create objects of abstract class and interface
              =>we can only create objects of the class to which it is inherited.

interface Iracing
{

void wheeling();

}
abstract class bikes{

public abstract void accelerate();

}

class Automobiles : bikes,Iracing{

public override void accelerate(){

///body of accelerate function;

}
public vod wheeling(){

}
}

so we can create objects of Automobile class but not for abstract class and interfaces
