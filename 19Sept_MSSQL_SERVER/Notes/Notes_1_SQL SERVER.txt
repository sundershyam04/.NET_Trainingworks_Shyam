
Introduction to MS-SQL Server
-----------------------------

SQL Server--- database
RDBMS---Relational database management system.

It is a Microsoft product, versions starting from 2005,2008,2012,2014,2016 etc

Editions:
Express----- Learning purpose--- 30 days trial pack
Enterprise----- purchase required

------->Run as an administrator<-------
Express:
To work with MS SQL SERVER
1)SQL Server Management Studio--- allow/help/prompt you to connect to SQL Server
2)SQL Server------server--- multiple databases

1)SQL Server works with Windows authentication, sql server authentication and mixed authentication.
Logged into windows OS-----Select Windows Authentication----recommended for learning purpose(use windows userid & password)
Sql server authentication----(default username: sa/default password: sa)
you can customize your userid/password
Mixed Authentication---- windows userid+password & sql server userid + password



1) Database engine------ SS Database engine----working with multiple databases
2) Reporting Services---- SSRS
3) Analysis Services---- SSAS
4) Integration Services---- SSIS

Architecture of MS SQL Server
---------------------------------
Client -Server
Whenever u want to connect to the server-----
Services.msc----(Instance)SQL express/MSSQL server

client Server Architecture:
server takes request, processes the request & replies to the client with the processed data.

Major 3 components
1) Protocol engine: Shared Memory,TCP/IP,Named Pipes
2) Relational engine: CMD Parser,Optimiser,Query Executor
3) Storage engine:File Types, Buffer Manage,Access Methods, Plan Cache, Transaction Manager and
Data Parsing: Buffer Cache and Data Storage.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
When the server & client are same computer/machine-- Shared Memory
If client and server on different computer/machine on a  different network---- TCPIP
If client and server on different computer/machine on a  intranet---- Named Pipes

Relational Engine--(Query Processor)-----> What is required for the query, how will it be more  efficient in its execution.

Cmd Parser-- Syntax check
          --- semantic check
          --- query tree

restaurant in  bangalore---->french language--->waiter-------> unable to process your request.


Storage engine--store the data on the disk  or any devices, retrieve the data when needed.

Data File & Extent
1 Extent---8 pages

Data File, physically stores the data in the form of pages.

the maintenance done by extents.
header---96 bytes
Each page has a header(metadata----page type,page number,used size,free size,pointer to next page)

2 types of files:
1) Primary:(Extension: MDF) Every database will contain 1 primary file,which stores data related to tables,triggers, different types of objects in the database.
2) Secondary :(Extension: NDF): Contains user specific data
3)Log File: (Extension: LDF)---Also called Write ahead logs.
Used for transaction management.

IF SQL SERVER crashes, u will be able to retrieve from the ldf file


Access Manager/Access Methods: Differentiates between the query
1) Select---- Buffer Manager
2) Non Select----Transaction Manager

It acts as an interface between the query processor/executor & BufferManager & Transaction Manager.
Query Received	passed to  Access Methods---- differentiates the job

       BufferManager <-----(Select)   Access Methods (Non Select) ---->     TransactionManager
	(Select)					                     (Non Select)


1) DDL query,selet statement the Buffer Manager elses Transation Manager

Buffer Manager:Plan Cache,Data parsing and dirty page. Provides the data required for processing the query.
Plan Cache:
Existing Query Plan: If it has the same query processed earlier, it will show that output and plan
First Time Cache Plan: If it has the new query, it will create a execution plan and store it in the cache.


Transaction Manager: ------ When its non-select

1)Log Manager------- keeps a track of all the updates which are made 
Log sequence number with transaction id and modification record.

	 OldData 		New Data
Insert    no                      yes
Update     yes			yes
delete	   yes	                 no

Save---commit
undo----rollback.

Keeps a track of committed and rollbacked data.



2) Lock Manager:
while updating a record it will be in lock state---Locking, ie only a single user will be able to 
update  a record at a particular point of time.
Lock Manager does the locking.
This Achieves data consistency and isolation.
Inconsistent--
consistent----
3) Execution Process---- Log manager starts logging and lock manager locks the data.
the data is in the buffer manager and copy  to be updated in the log manager,in the data buffer.
When data comes to a page where it is stored, its called a dirty page.


Checkpoint--- The process of run and mark all the pages from the dirty pages to the dis, but then
the page is in the cache.
Write Ahead Logging---
Frequency of pushing the data to the disk is every 1 minute, before disk data goes to the buffer log. And so this is called Write Ahead Logging.

Lazy writer----accumulate and has no space to work in the buffer, it is to be pushed to clear the 
data pages.
(LRU)Least recently used algorithm for cleaning page from the buffer pool to the disk.
